Markdown is a simple text format whose goal is to be very easy to read and write, even when not converted to HTML.  This demo page will let you type anything you like and see how it gets converted.  Live.  No more waiting around.\r\n\r\nHow To Use The Demo\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\n1. Type in stuff on the left.\r\n2. See the live updates on the right.\r\n\r\nThat's it.  Pretty simple.  There's also a drop-down option above to switch between various views:\r\n\r\n- **Preview:**  A live display of the generated HTML as it would render in a browser.\r\n- **HTML Source:**  The generated HTML before your browser makes it pretty.\r\n- **Lexer Data:**  What [marked] uses internally, in case you like gory stuff like this.\r\n- **Quick Reference:**  A brief run-down of how to format things using markdown.\r\n\r\nWhy Markdown?\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nIt's easy.  It's not overly bloated, unlike HTML.  Also, as the creator of [markdown] says,\r\n\r\n\u003e The overriding design goal for Markdown's\r\n\u003e formatting syntax is to make it as readable\r\n\u003e as possible. The idea is that a\r\n\u003e Markdown-formatted document should be\r\n\u003e publishable as-is, as plain text, without\r\n\u003e looking like it's been marked up with tags\r\n\u003e or formatting instructions.\r\n\r\nReady to start writing?  Either start changing stuff on the left or\r\n[clear everything](/demo/?text=) with a simple click.\r\n\r\n[Marked]: https://github.com/markedjs/marked/\r\n[Markdown]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\r\n","PartialContent":"Marked - Markdown Pa","ImageURL":"","Subject":"","Author":"Anonymous","ParentID":"","Timestamp":"09-12-2024 01:16:38","IP":"184.4.69.199","Sticky":false,"Locked":false,"Page":0},{"BoardID":"a","ThreadID":"6","PostID":23,"Content":"`code1`\r\n```code2```","PartialContent":"`code1`\r\n```code2```","ImageURL":"","Subject":"","Author":"Anonymous","ParentID":"","Timestamp":"09-12-2024 01:17:38","IP":"184.4.69.199","Sticky":false,"Locked":false,"Page":0},{"BoardID":"a","ThreadID":"6","PostID":24,"Content":"# Lorem Ipsum\r\n\r\n## Heading Level 2\r\n\r\n### Heading Level 3\r\n\r\n**Bold text** and *italic text* are often used for emphasis.\r\n\r\nYou can also use `inline code` in your text.\r\n\r\n### Lists\r\n\r\n- Unordered list item 1\r\n- Unordered list item 2\r\n  - Sub-item 1\r\n  - Sub-item 2\r\n\r\n1.
